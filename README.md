a simple registration form 
**TASK -> Please create a user registration form where we need to accept user full name as first, middle and last name in separate fields. For better ease of communication, we should ask for user email id and phone number(s). We can use the user email as login name so that user can sign in to our application. Donâ€™t forget to collect the password, date of birth and gender. We have to save user current address and permanent address with city, state, country and zip code.  That way we can find out how many users have registered from which area. It is not a bad idea to ask users for their personal interests, like, sports, books, computer & software, fashion, photography etc. You can add more such options for personal interests. User should able to select as many as personal interests they want. That way we can understand what they might order in future once the website is available. Place a beautifil logo(50px X 50px) on my website and a cool looking banner(banner height should not be more than 280px). I don't mind if you download it from somewhere for now. Our design team will provide the images later with the same pixel.**
